This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to implicit data type conversion during MOVE operations.  The bug arises when a numeric value is moved to an alphanumeric field without explicit type handling. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in subsequent arithmetic or comparison operations. The solution shows how to handle the conversion explicitly to prevent this issue.
